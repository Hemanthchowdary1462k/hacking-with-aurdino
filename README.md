# Hacking_with_Arduino
This project is based on using Arduino boards as Teensy or USB RubberDucky.

A few of the arduino boards support keyboard and mouse libraries, which means that they can act as HID devices.
Therefore these little devices can silently perform human actions such as typing keys, moving and clicking like a mouse, and many other things.
For this we can use Arduino Pro Micro.

Steps:
1. Plug in Arduino Pro Micro into a system in which arduino software is installed.
2. Navigate to "Tools" Option from the main menu and then select board as "Arduino Leonardo".
3. Then paste the code present in the "Arduino code" file by editing the essentials like Payload and Listener HOST address.
4. Then upload the code by pressing the "-->" icon present below the menu bar.
5. Now plug into the device which you want to be hacked.

Hava a Happy hacking!!
